Prime Factorization from Coding Challenges by Silvio Duka

Every natural number can be expressed as a product of prime numbers.

Such a product representation is called prime factorization. 

For Example: 

300 = 2 ^ 2 * 3 ^ 1 * 5 ^ 2 

580 = 2 ^ 2 * 5 ^ 1 * 29 ^ 1 

Task: 

Write a program to display the prime factorization of a given number.
